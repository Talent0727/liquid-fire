<h2>Choosing Transition Animations</h2>

<p>Each transition rule must have exactly one <code>use()</code>
statement. It determines what we'll do if the rule matches.</p>

<p>Each transition may also have one <code>reverse()</code>
statement. It determines what we'll do if the <i>opposite rule</i>
matches, where the opposite rule swaps <code>fromRoute</code>
with <code>toRoute</code> and swaps <code>fromModel</code>
with <code>toModel</code>.</p>

<p>For situations where <code>use()</code> is the same as 
<code>reverse()</code>, we can use the <code>useAndReverse</code> 
shortcut.  This is the same as having the identical rules for 
both <code>use()</code> and <code>reverse()</code></p>
